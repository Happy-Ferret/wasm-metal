# wasm-metal
A bare metal physical implementation of WebAssembly. That's right, a WebAssembly CPU.

## Why is this a good idea?

## Roadmap

- [ ] Understand the WebAssembly ISA
- [ ] Implement the mircoarchitecture in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  * This will be a GUI simulator of the microarchitecture
  * This simulator will become the specification for the microarchitecture
  * It will allow us to quickly experiment with hardware configurations
  * It will allow us to iterate and learn how the microarchitecture should work
- [ ] Implement the microarchitecture in a Hardware Description Language
- [ ] Simulate the HDL microarchitecture design
- [ ] Test the implementation on an FPGA
- [ ] Design the ASIC
