# wasm-metal
A bare metal physical implementation of WebAssembly. That's right, a WebAssembly CPU.

## Why is this a good idea?

## Roadmap

- [ ] Understand the WebAssembly ISA
- [ ] Create a microarchitecture GUI simulator in HTML/CSS/JavaScript
  * This simulator will become the specification for the microarchitecture
  * It will allow us to quickly experiment with hardware configurations
  * It will allow us to iterate and learn how the microarchitecture should work
- [ ] Implement the microarchitecture simulator in a Hardware Description Language for execution on an FPGA
- [ ] Verify that the FPGA works simulated
- [ ] Verify that the physical FPGA works
